Purpose:
Create a Browser app that allows you to prompt a use for input criteria and then generate a batch of PDF reports.

Reports are stored as a BLOB column in a Database table with metadata about the report and then presented to the user in a grid.

The reports are then available for future reference from a search.  ( not included )

Original use case was to save reports generated from month end and year end General Ledger closeouts.  

To run:

Download all code and the attached database backup file (aspnet-PDFEngine-2014120511936.bak) 

Verify that connection string in Web.Config is correct for your environment.

Install Telerik Reporting and KendoUI and verify that the references are correct. 

Run the app.
